## 📌 Project Motivation

The MNIST dataset is considered the "Hello World" of computer vision and deep learning. This project is built for:

- Understanding and applying deep learning concepts using TensorFlow
- Exploring classification tasks in computer vision
- Evaluating model performance using real-world data
- Visualizing predictions and model insights

---

## 🛠 Features

- 📥 Loads the MNIST digit dataset
- 🧼 Normalizes and preprocesses the data
- 🧠 Builds a neural network with TensorFlow/Keras
- 🏋️ Trains the model with accuracy tracking and early stopping
- 📉 Evaluates using accuracy, confusion matrix, and sample predictions
- 📈 Visualizes data, predictions, and training history

## 🧠 Model Architecture

```text
Input: 28x28 grayscale image → Flattened to 784-dim vector

Model:
  - Dense(512 units) + ReLU
  - Dense(10 units) + Softmax

Loss: Sparse Categorical Crossentropy  
Optimizer: Adam  
Metric: Accuracy
