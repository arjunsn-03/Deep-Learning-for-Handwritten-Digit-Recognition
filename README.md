# üß† Handwritten Digit Classification using TensorFlow and MNIST

This project demonstrates a deep learning approach to classifying handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset and TensorFlow's Keras API. It covers the full machine learning workflow ‚Äî from data loading and preprocessing to model building, training, evaluation, and visualization.

---

## üìå Overview

- **Dataset:** MNIST (60,000 training + 10,000 testing images of digits 0‚Äì9)
- **Framework:** TensorFlow 2.x with Keras
- **Task:** Multiclass image classification
- **Model Type:** Fully-connected (dense) neural network

---

## üß† Model Architecture

```

Input Layer: 28x28 grayscale image (flattened)
Hidden Layer: Dense(512 units) + ReLU
Output Layer: Dense(10 units) + Softmax

````

- **Loss Function:** Sparse Categorical Crossentropy  
- **Optimizer:** Adam  
- **Metric:** Accuracy  
- **Callback:** EarlyStopping (stops training at 98% accuracy)
